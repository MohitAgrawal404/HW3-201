## Setup
Hey! Since this is a zip file I will give you two options to run it. 

1. Locally:

- You will need to open the entire folder in an application such as VS Code and then click on submission.ipynb. 
- Then you must select a Python kernel typically from the top right, any should do. 
- Then you should be able to run the submission.ipynb file. 
- This should work assuming you have python installed and have had it working in the past however it is hard for me to know what issues your python installation might have as well as what extensions you might need to install which I why I recommend option 2. 

2. GitHub Code Spaces (recommended)
- Go to this link: https://github.com/MohitAgrawal404/HW1-201 
- At the top right you will see a green button called `Use this template`, click it and then you should see  `Create a new repository` to copy this repo to your GitHub account.

- Open that newly created repository that is under your account and then click on the green button that says `Code` and then switch to the menu in there that says `codespaces`. 
- Next to the word codespaces there should be a `+`, click that and then it should open a code space. 
- Navigate to the file called submission.ipynb. On the top right you should see a button that says `Select Kernel`, Click it. 
- Now in the popup at the top select `Python Environments...` and then click on the one that says `Python 3.12.8 recommended`. 
- Now you should be able to run the cells. Make sure you run them in order or else you will get errors.  

## Instructions
- Run all of the cells in order and wait for the previous cell to complete running. 
- When an output is outputted if it says `Output is truncated` at the bottom of that output cell then click on the blue words that say `scrollable element` next to it. 
- If you do not click that the output will be displayed incorrectly and be missing things. 

## Thank you!
